# TownBuilder

  Welcome to TownBuilder! In TownBuilder, your objective is to place resources on a 4x4 board to construct different buildings each with their way of earning points to win.
  
  TownBuilder is a way for me to practice my Java coding skills, and is based on the board game "Tiny Towns" created by Peter McPherson and published by AEG Games. No copyright 
  infringement is intended. 
  
  Compiled with Java 17 and Gradle 7.3.3. To launch the compiled jar, open a terminal (PowerShell, Terminal, etc) in the directory where the .jar is. Then run "java -jar (jar name)".
