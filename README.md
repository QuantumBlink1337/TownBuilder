# TownBuilder

  Welcome to TownBuilder! In TownBuilder, your objective is to place resources on a 4x4 board to construct different buildings each with their way of earning points to win.
  
  TownBuilder is a way for me to practice my Java coding skills, and is based on the board game "Tiny Towns" created by Peter McPherson and published by AEG Games. No copyright
