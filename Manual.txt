======== Welcome Text =========

Welcome to TownBuilder! You are the mayor of a town founded deep in the woods. It's up to you to build the town to success!
To do so, you'll be using five resources: Wheat, Glass, Brick, Stone, and Wood. You can place these on the board using coordinates, 
like a1, or c4. You can create buildings from patterns of resources to earn points. The goal of the game is to earn as many points as possible!
When you successfully design a building, the game will let you decide if you'd like to place it or not
For the first two turns, the resource you place will be decided for you. On the third turn, you can choose which resource you need.
But be warned! For every resource you leave off the board, you lose a point! It's up to you to design the perfect town.
You can reread this prompt as well as access other game information with the 'help' command during your turn.

======== Rules ========

~ Placement:

    Buildings are made by placing resources on your board. Each building has its own unique pattern of 
what it looks like. The base pattern see: display patterns can be rotated and mirrored. For example,
the Cottage can have 8 different orientations! Note: If a building pattern has NONE as part of it, it just means
it doesn't matter what's there!

~ Objective

The goal of TownBuilder is to construct as many buildings as possible to earn points.
The game ends when you have nowhere else to place a resource or building. Planning is key!

~ Scoring

Each building has it's own unique rules on how they accumulate points. 
But remember - for each resource you leave on the board you LOSE a point! It's up to you 
to figure out how to build your town for the most points possible.
